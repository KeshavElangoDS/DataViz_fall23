# Data Visualization Fall 2023

## Course Information

**Time**: Monday 6:00pm - 8:50pm

**Location**: BSB-134

**Office Hours**: Please schedule an appointment!

### Instructor Information

**Name**: *Nicholas Sanchirico*  
**Email**: nesan@camden.rutgers.edu  

## Course Description

This is a one-semester introduction to data management and visualization techniques. While there will be a large focus on the visualization of data, data is rarely ever ready for that. This necessarily means that we also learn how to effectively transform our data. Students will learn how to use the Python programming language to load and manipulate data in order to tell data-driven stories. The Python programming language along with popular data science packages are used extensively.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Students should be comfortable working with computers and navigating digital systems. While students are not expected to be Python experts, they are expected to be able to pick up the necessary skills for this course. *This is a hands-on, coding heavy course*. Mathematically students should be well versed in the basics for algebra, linear algebra, and more.

### Grading Policy

The semester will feature the following grades:

* 10 quizzes: 15%
* 7 homework assignments: 45%
* 1 midterm examination: 20%
* 1 final project: 20%

Assignments and quizzes cannot be made up if missed, with exceptions given only to events that require university support.

#### Final Grades

Letter grades are assigned as follows:

* `89.5 - 100.0` = `A`
* `86.5 - 89.49` = `B+`
* `79.5 - 86.49` = `B`
* `76.5 - 79.49` = `C+`
* `69.5 - 76.49` = `C`
* `59.5 - 69.49` = `D`
* `00.0 - 59.49` = `F`

#### Extra Credit

There will be a handful of opportunities for extra credit. Any point(s) awarded are applied directly to your final grade, up to a maximum of 4 points.

## ChatGPT & AI Technologies

ChatGPT and other AI technologies are in fact powerful tools, and in modern times these tools are accessible to all. While you are not explicitly prohibited from using these tools to facilitate and enhance your learning experience, **you are strictly prohibited from using these tools to perform your work for you**. Using these tools to complete assignments and/or assigned tasks is unproductive for your learning, and using these tools to complete assignments and/or tasks indicates to me that you do not actually know the material. **As such, using ChatGPT and other AI technologies is considered in violation of the academic integrity polocy for this course**. If I suspect that such an AI tool was used to complete any graded work for this course, at a minimum a grade of 0 will be given for that work. No exceptions under any circumstances will be made.

## University Policies on Academic Integrity

Principles of academic integrity require that every Rutgers University student:

* properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others
* properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work
* make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of unsanctioned materials or unsanctioned collaboration
* obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her * interpretation or conclusions
* treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress
* uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for which he or she is preparing.

Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to insure that:

* everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments
* all student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others
* the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered
* the reputation of the University for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced.

Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld.

Infractions are not taken lightly and will fully be pursued. For additional information, visit [http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/](http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/)

## University Policies on Disabilities

Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs. In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation:

[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines](https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines).

If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campusâ€™s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this process, please complete the Registration form at [https://webapps.rutgers.edu/student-ods/forms/registration](https://webapps.rutgers.edu/student-ods/forms/registration).
